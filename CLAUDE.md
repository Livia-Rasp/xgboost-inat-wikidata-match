# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repository.

A record-linkage classifier (XGBoost) that matches Wikidata taxon items to candidate
iNaturalist taxa, built on data from
[wikidata-inat-checker](https://github.com/Livia-Rasp/wikidata-inat-checker).

Vault note: `XGBoost iNat Wikidata Match` in knowledge vault. Project-level ToDos
live there, not here — query with `vault_tasks` / `vault_overview` (`winged-eye-obsidian` MCP,
read-only; never write to the vault).

## The spec

**[`docs/inat-wikidata-match-spec.md`](docs/inat-wikidata-match-spec.md) is the design doc for
this whole project — read it before writing any code.** It fixes the repo layout, the candidate
generation strategy, the feature set, the model config, the evaluation metrics, and an ordered,
checkable milestone list (§7). Follow it rather than improvising an alternative shape; if a part
of it turns out to be wrong once code exists, that is a discussion to have with Livia, not a
silent deviation.

## Commands

Nothing is built yet — no `pyproject.toml`, no `src/`. This section gets filled in as the spec's
milestones (§7) land, with the exact runnable commands and their flags.

## Conventions

Python, per the spec's §0 repo shape (`src/`, `pyproject.toml`, `data/` gitignored,
`gold/hard_cases.csv` committed). No conventions beyond the spec are settled yet.
