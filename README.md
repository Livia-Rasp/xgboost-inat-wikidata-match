# xgboost-inat-wikidata-match

A record-linkage classifier ([XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) that decides
whether a Wikidata taxon item and a candidate iNaturalist taxon refer to the same taxon. Built
on the data already indexed by
[wikidata-inat-checker](https://github.com/Livia-Rasp/wikidata-inat-checker), with the goal of
shrinking the manual review queue its `npm run links` command produces.

Full specification: [`docs/inat-wikidata-match-spec.md`](docs/inat-wikidata-match-spec.md).

## Status

Nothing is implemented yet — this repo currently holds only the spec. No commands run.

## Install / run

Not yet — the Python package layout (`pyproject.toml`, `src/`) described in the spec has not
been built. This section will carry the real commands once it has.
